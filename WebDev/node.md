node is a runtime environment and a library.


* We want to serve web pages, therefore we need an **HTTP server**
* Our server will need to answer differently to requests, depending on
  which URL the request was asking for, thus we need some kind of
  **router** in order to map requests to request handlers
* To fullfill the requests that arrived at the server and have been
  routed using the router, we need actual **request handlers**
* The router probably should also treat any incoming POST data and give
  it to the request handlers in a convenient form, thus we need
  **request data handling**
* We not only want to handle requests for URLs, we also want to display
  content when these URLs are requested, which means we need some kind
  of **view logic** the request handlers can use in order to send
  content to the user's browser
* Last but not least, the user will be able to upload images, so we are
  going to need some kind of **upload handling** which takes care of the
  details
