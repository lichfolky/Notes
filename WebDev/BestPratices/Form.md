Checklist #
- Use meaningful HTML elements: <form>, <input>, <label>, and <button>.
- Label each input with a <label>.
- Use element attributes to access built-in browser features: type, name, autocomplete, required, autofocus.
- Give input name and id attributes stable values that don't change between page loads or website deployments.
- Ensure successful form submission.
- Use aria-label and aria-describedby.
- Don't double-up inputs.
- Design forms so the mobile keyboard doesn't obscure inputs or buttons.
- Ensure forms are usable on mobile: use legible text, and make sure inputs and buttons are large enough to work as touch targets.
- Maintain branding and style on your sign-up and sign-in pages.
- Test in the field as well as the lab: build page analytics, interaction analytics, and user-centric performance measurement into your sign-up and sign-in flow.
- Test across browsers and devices: form behaviour varies significantly across platforms.
