**Social model of disability**
defines a disability as being caused by the way society is organized or how products are designed rather than a person's ability or difference.

As designers, we need to account for disabilities that are permanent, temporary, or situational in our designs.

Situational challenges often aren't considered legal disabilities, but we still need to solve them.

An example of a situational challenge is when you're driving on a dark road late at night, your vision is probably not as clear as it would be in the daylight, which is a situational challenge.
Another example is if you're visiting a country where you don't speak the language, your hearing is situationally limited.

takeaway: if we make the design of a product easier for people with disabilities, we also often make it a better experience for everyone else.
