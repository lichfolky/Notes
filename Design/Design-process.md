Netflix showing you movies to watch based on your taste preferences and history is personalization.
With anticipatory design, the interface actually changes in the moment as you’re interacting with an app.

Let’s say someone is shopping for a very expensive guitar on guitarcenter.com. At checkout the site would automagically present “Ship to store for pick-up” as a default choice because it knows by observing the past behavior of other users, buying expensive guitars, that they would prefer to pick it up at the nearest brick-and-mortar store.

Anticipatory design’s promise is the elimination of friction and an increase in efficiency that would greatly improve user experiences, and in turn impact the bottom line. People return to products and services that deliver what they want when they want it.
