webfonts!=desktop fonts (system fonts)

if you don't pay it's hard to distinguish the website

responsive layout -> change at breackpoints

### Font formats

open type .otf most customization
truetype .ttf
EOT .eot la merda
woff .woff web fonts, compressed
woff2 .woff2 web fonts, more compressed

where we are in the web?
navigation paragraph
headlines?

chose text typeface before display typefaces and make it the anchor if possible

is readble?
good x height, too high(uppercase similar to lowercase) or too low?
xheight a good mesaure 60/75% cap height, good text base

space between space, white space, too much or too less bad legibility
better not change with code

right color?
blur closing the eyes, are there dark splashes or uneven places?

# numbers

Old style
lining hfigures

disply shoul nhave tigher space than text
short descenderand asce

monospace good for code same horizontal space, no good body text

mood!!!! Text is sarcastic, cold, warm, etc...

## faux

don't do faux bold and italic if you don't have the typeface and the right weight dont
use only true bold amd true italic. So be sure you have all the weights.

### Text sizes

16px - 24px for body text
when in doubt use the biggest size

# The typographic scale

dipende da distanza da schermo
classic
123 12
16

nice with base size 20px?
Perfect Fourth scale
Perfect Fifth scale
Major Third
https://type-scale.com/

Horizontal space:

## Measure

45-75 characters per line for a single column of text

60 ideal
multiple columns: 40-50

pleace a aymbol at the first and last char,
then check with the width: body font size \* 30

calc(1rem * 30)
16\*30 = 480
20\*30 = 600


## Tracking / Letterspacing

thighter letter spacing => heavier feel


**general rules**
- reduce letterspacing headings by 3%-5%
- increase letterspacing in small caps or uppercase text by 5%-10%
- no change in body texxt

no optical but metric tracking

## Kerning
space beetween two specific letters
choose a good balanced font

## Ligatures 
connect certain char combinations, usually in serif fonts

### Leading 
line height, line spacing, interlinea
between baselines (under letters )

135% - 185%

but any typeface it's different

150% good start point

first body copy

check also headings->
if text size increase,  line space decrease


### Vertical ritm

balance layout, anhance readability
consistent line and paragraph spacing
develop pattern recogniction


remember in figma grid layout and crate text boxes

rows of line height

2 rows after text and before subheading to avoid floating text (when you dont know what paragraph an heading belongs )

breake the grid when an element needs to stand-out 

## indentation

around the size of the body text (1m)
Don't indent the first line of the first paragraph
Don't indent the first line after a heading
Don't indent the first line after an image



hierarchy 

size content

sckeck up a wireframe
what is important

create hierarchy and differentiate different part of content, two different things

typography it'also about the white space around our content
keyrole in readability, relax sight and let user breath

## Text alignment 

giustified texts create rivers, and it's no really legible it they are too big

avoid big white spaces at the left in  left aligned texts. To avoid those gaps change font sizes and line lenght.

right to left texts are more legible if right aligned.

centered aligned, difficult to read don't center if more of three lines of text.

## small caps
for official titles, headiings article titles, opening lines of chapter or article or ,works well with old stiles figures (alegria) 
check for support

## Drop cap
 large letter at beginning text

## colors
check good contrast

#333 and #F9F9F9
#1e1e1e and #F9F9F9 amd 999999 and AE372E 

chec color contrast scores
AA Large for headings or > = 18 px
AAA for max legibility and long text
AA for body text

contrast can be used to create hierarchy and draw attenction

pure black on a white it's hard to the eyes, gray gives nouance

not too many colors, the user should recognize hierarchy

don't use only colors for status and definitions

blockquotes
headings 
metadfata 
navigation
